# 🚨 Problem Statement

### The Hidden Crisis in Higher Education

Academic failure is rarely sudden.  
It is preceded by **behavioural instability**.

Yet, most institutions rely on:

- Semester-end grades  
- Missed exams  
- Performance decline  

By the time those indicators appear,  
**burnout has already progressed.**

Built for the **Behavioural Analytics Hackathon – Early Detection of Student Burnout & Dropout Risk**.

# 🧠 Core Innovation

We model **behavioural instability over time**, not static engagement.

Instead of “low attendance”, we detect:

- 📉 Attendance decline patterns  
- 📉 LMS login drop trends  
- 📈 Assignment delay escalation  
- 😊 Sentiment deterioration  
- 📊 Behavioural volatility  

This enables **early-stage burnout detection before academic collapse**.

# 🗂 Synthetic Dataset Disclosure (Mandatory)

## 📌 Dataset Type
**Synthetic Behavioural Dataset**

## ❓ Why Synthetic?

- No publicly available real-world behavioural burnout dataset exists  
- Student behavioural and mental health data is highly sensitive  
- Universities do not release LMS + sentiment behavioural logs  

Therefore, a controlled synthetic dataset was generated to simulate realistic academic behaviour patterns.

---

## ⚙️ How the Dataset Was Generated

### 👥 Scale
- 2000 Students  
- 16 Academic Weeks  
- Weekly behavioural logs  

Total behavioural records:  
`2000 students × 16 weeks = 32,000 time-series entries`

---

### 🧩 Behavioural Archetypes Simulated

| Profile Type | Behaviour Pattern |
|--------------|------------------|
| Consistent Performer | Stable activity across weeks |
| Gradual Burnout | Slow decline in attendance & engagement |
| Sudden Disengagement | Normal early activity → sudden crash |
| Chronic Low Engagement | Persistently low engagement |

---

### 📐 Generation Logic

Each student is assigned:

1. **Baseline Behaviour (Weeks 1–4)**
   - Stable attendance
   - Stable LMS logins
   - Normal submission delay
   - Neutral sentiment

2. **Behavioural Drift (Weeks 5–16)**
   - Gradual linear decline (burnout profile)
   - Sudden exponential drop (disengagement)
   - Persistent low baseline (chronic)
   - Gaussian noise added for realism

3. **Random Noise Injection**
   - Normal distribution noise
   - Variance spikes
   - Irregular fluctuations

This ensures data is not linearly predictable and simulates real behavioural irregularities.
